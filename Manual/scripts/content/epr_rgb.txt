% rgb.m: translates a colour from multiple formats into matlab colour format
% type 'rgb demo' to get started
%
% [matlabcolor]=rgb(col)
% matlab colors are in the format [R G B]
%
% if 'col' is a string, it is interpreted as
%
% 	[[modifier] descriptor] colour_name
%
% where
%		modifier is one of   (slightly, normal, very, extremely)
%		descriptor is one of (light/pale, normal, dark)
%		colorname is a name of a colour
%			(type 'rgb list' or 'rgb demo' to see them all)
%
% if 'col' is an integer between 0 and &HFFFFFF inclusive,
% it is interpreted as a double word RGB value in the form
% [0][R][G][B]
%
% if 'col' is a negative integer between -1 and -&HFFFFFF
% inclusive, it is interpreted as the complement of a double
% word RGB value in the form [0][B][G][R]
%
% if 'col' is a string of the form 'qbX' or 'qbXX' where X
% is a digit then the number part is interpreted as a qbasic
% color
%
% if 'col' is one of {k,w,r,g,b,y,m,c} a sensible result is
% returned
%
% if 'col' is already in matlab format, it is unchanged
