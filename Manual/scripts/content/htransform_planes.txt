$descon$
Takes a list of points and a list of transformations and applies the respective transformation to
the points on each plane.
pointlist - list of points (float, Nx3xM, N - number of planes, M - number of points)
Alist - transformation matrix (float, 4x4xN, N - number of planes)
newpoints - translation vector (float, Nx3xM, N - number of planes, M - number of points)
