function [list, unmatched] =  epr_combine_lists (list1,list2,field_to_match, add_string)
%Takes each structure in list 1, looks at field to match and compares it to
%each structure in list 2. If a match is found, a new field in list_1 is
%created and the matched strucutre of list2 is added to the new list as a field.

%This can be made more elegant when I have time. It basically means that
%you will be matching based on a string (probably experiment name and
%creating nesting structures to hold information. Long term that is
%probably a bad idea, but merging structures that may or may not have the
%same fields is a hard problem.
